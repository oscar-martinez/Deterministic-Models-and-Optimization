O all you host of heaven!  O earth!  What else?  And shall I couple hell?  Oh, fie!  Hold,
hold,  my heart,  And you,  my sinews,  grow not instant old,  But bear me stiffly up.  Remember
thee!  Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.  Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all
forms,  all  pressures  past  That  youth  and  observation  copied  there,  And  thy  commandment  all
alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with baser matter.  Yes, by
heaven!  O most pernicious woman!  O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!  My tables!  Meet it
is I set it down That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.  At least I’m sure it may be so in
Denmark.  So, uncle, there you are.  Now to my word.
