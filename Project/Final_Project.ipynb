    "## 1.1. Discussion of Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "  The edit distance measures the minimum number of operations (single-character edits) required to change a string $A$ of length $m$ into a string $B$ with length $n$. The distance has many applications across linguistics, bioinformatics and other fields. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## 1.2. The Proposed Algorithm and Algorithmic Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "We employ a dynamic programming approach to compute the edit distance. Dynamic programming refers to the method of recursively breaking up a problem into sub-problems. In the situation where we can optimally solve the problem by breaking up the problem into sub-problems, then solving them optimally - the problem is said to have an **optimal substructure**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further more, we take advantage of the process of **memoization**, which is a technique of saving values to previously computed sub-problems. This improves the speed of the calculation but requires more memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm works by computing a matrix containing $D(i,j)$ for $0 ≤ i ≤ m$ and $0 ≤ j ≤ n$ where D(i,j) represents the minimum edit distance between the first $i$ characters of string $A$ and the first $j$ characters of string $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first fill the base cases of the problem, the first row and column of the matrix corresponding to  $D(i,j)$ where $i = 0$ or $j = 0$, this is the edit distance between $A[i]$ and the $0$ string or $A[j]$ and the $0$ string. The minimum edit distance in these cases is clearly $i$ and $j$ respectively as we simply need to insert/delete $i/j$ characters to achieve the objective string. The $[0,0]$ entry of the matrix corresponds to distance between two $0$ empty strings which is evidently zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then proceed to iterate over rows then columns, calculating $D(i,j)$ at each step. To calculate this optimally, we consider the cost of an insertion, deletion and a substitution (the only three options when assessing what to do with the $ith$ and $jth$ entries of $A$ and $B$). The minimum of these three assessments is taken as optimal edit distance at this $i$ and $j$ value. Each insertion or deletion has a cost of 1, and a substitution has a cost of 1 only if $A[i] ≠ B[j]$. An insertion requires us to insert $B[j]$ and then assess $D(i,j-1)$ (optimum not including the inserted $B[j]$). A deletion requires us to delete $A[i]$ and then assess $D(i-1,j)$ (optimum not including the deleted $A[i]$). A substitution requires us either to keep things the same if $(A[i] = B[j])$ and then the cost remains $D(i-1,j-1)$, if $(A[i] ≠ B[j])$, we increase the cost by 1 and assess $D(i-1,j-1)$. These processes are explained more succintly below in the proof of correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D(i,j) = min\\{D(i-1,j)+1, D(i,j-1)+1, D(i-1,j-1) + \\textbf{1}_{\\{i≠j\\}}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the operations required to convert the string, we simply backtrack through the matrix choosing the minimum each time - the direction of the step tells us whether we inserted, deleted or substituted."

Therefore, if our dist_matrix has a size $(n+1,m+1)$ we will be doing $4(n+1)(m+1)$, expanding this out and disregarding constants, we find that the complexity scales as:\n",

    "Suppose we have two strings $A$ and $B$ with lengths $m$ and $n$ respectively. Let $D(m,n)$ represent the Levenshtein Distance between the two full strings and $D(i,j)$ represent the distance between the first $i$ characters of A and the first $j$ characters of B.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.4.2. Base cases for induction\n",
    "\n",
    "We require multiple base cases for this problem as each recursive step needs 3 other sub-problems to be optimally solved. Fortunately, showing the base cases is straightforward. Consider $D(i,j)$ where $i = 0$ or $j = 0$, this is equivalent to comparing the edit distance of the first $i$ characters of string $A$ to the $0$ string, clearly the minimum edit distance in this case is the insertion/deletion of the $i$ characters - $D(i,0) = i$. A symmetrical argument gives $D(0,j) = j$. The final trivial base case is $D(0,0) = 0$ as the edit distance between two empty strings is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4.3. Inductive step\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to show that by assuming we can optimally solve the $D(i-1,j)$, $D(i,j-1)$ and $D(i-1,j-1)$ sub-problems  $\\implies D(i,j)$ is also optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here it is important to recognise that there are only 3 possibilities when editing $A[i]$ into $B[j]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Substitution** - Compare $A[i]$ and $B[j]$, if they are equal, the cost is 0, if they are different, we add a cost of 1. In both cases, we add this cost to the optimal cost of the sub-problem $D(i-1,j-1)$ which is already solved due to the inductive assumption. We summarise this below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " $$D(i,j) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{11}\n",
    "1 + D(i-1,j-1) & \\mbox{if $A[i] ≠ B[j]$}\\\\\n",
    "D(i-1,j-1) & \\mbox{if $A[i] = B[j]$} \n",
    "\\end{array} \\right. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Insertion** - In this case we need to insert $B[j]$ into the string which has a cost of 1. So our cost will be 1 + the cost of editing $B[1...j-1]$ into $A[i]$ as we have chosen to insert $B[j]$ into the final edit. By assumption, $D(i,j-1)$ has already been computed optimally, so we again recover the optimal solution for $D(i,j)$ in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    " $$D(i,j) = 1 + D(i,j-1)$$\n",
    " \n",

    "* **Deletion** - In this we choose to delete $A[i]$ which has cost 1. So our will be 1 + the cost of editing $A[1...i-1]$ into $B[j]$ as we have chosen to delete $A[i]$ from the final edit at this point.$D(i-1,j)$ has already been computed optimally at this point so we again recover the optimal solution for $D(i,j)$ in this final case. \n",

    "\n",
    "Regular coding of the letters is based on an object called code tree. We start of by taking all the\n",
    "characters to inspect and put them as end nodes of that tree. Than we climb up and draw the\n",
    "preceding nodes and edges. In that procedure, we always match just two characters together to be in\n",
    "the same branch of the tree. At the last stage, we give values to the edges – either 0 or 1. Say, all left\n",
    "traversal is encoded to be 0 and right to be 1. Lastly, one is able to read of the code of the character\n",
    "by following the path from the start node to the character node.\n",

    "Huffman coding algorithm suggests however to make use of the frequencies while designing the\n",
    "Code Tree. As a result, the number of total bits, which directly rely on the frequencies can be\n",
    "decreased. This procedure goes as follows: one picks the characters with the lowest frequencies and\n",
    "tries to put them as the first end nodes of the tree (one also starts the creation of the tree from the\n",

    "Next, we search for next character node with the lowest frequency. As long as its individual frequency in not higher than the sum of the preceding nodesprinted in the S1 we add it up to a tree in the following manner. We place the character node and put and edge to a node that now represents the sum of the 3 character nodes’ frequencies S2. S2 is\n",
    "linking to S1 and hence has added up the branch with 3 rd character to the tree. This happens\n",

    "### 2.6.3. Comparison between English and German\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we compare, as requested, the differents between the codes associated to each text. As explained before, the codes are related with the frequency of appearance of a character. Therefore, shorter codes means that a character appears with a high frequency. We can see that the space is the most common character in both texts. However for the English one is coded with only two bits and for the German one with three. This is due to the fact that the German frequency dictionary is larger (30) than the English one (29). As a consequence, we need more bits to encode the same character. We can see how both languages use different letters, for example in English a is the second most used letter whereas in German is the 7th. The same happens with letter o: the third most used letter in the English text 14th in the German one."
